# Multinomial-Naive-Bayes-based-SMS-classifier
This project builds a Multinomial Naive Bayes model for spam classification of SMS messages.

# Data set
The data set consists of a simple table with SMS messages and their classification as 'spam' or 'ham'.

# Term frequency matrix
SkLearn's CountVectorizer class is used to create a term frequency matrix.

# Multinomial Naive Bayes Model
SkLearn's MultinomialNB class is used to build the model. 

# Model accuracy
An accuracy of 98.7% is achieved. ROC is curve is plotted and AUC of 0.992 is achieved.
